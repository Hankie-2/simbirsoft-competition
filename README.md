# :dragon_face: Legend
Our company "Drip-Chip" is engaged in chipping animals in the country "Wonderland" to track their movement and life cycles. The movement of animals on the planet is extremely important, including to protect them from death.

This year, our company decided to create a single database in which the records of past years will be transferred, in order to conduct multi-year experiments related to animal migrations, as well as to track changes in habitats and keep history.
